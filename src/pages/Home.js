        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div className="about-content">
          <p>I am Chris, a native New Yorker, artist, product designer, entrepreneur, and community organizer operating at the intersection of creativity, technology, and human coordination. My work revolves around exploring the impact of blockchain networks, DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs, with a focus on how these systems can enable positive-sum solutions for individuals and communities.</p>
          
          <p>As an artist, I delve into memetics and the collective consciousness, exploring how shared experiences, memories, imaginations, and even communal hallucinations weave into the fabric of our culture. As a cryptonative, I intertwine the ethos of shared digital and artistic spaces, pushing the boundaries of how art is created, perceived, and owned. My work challenges us to consider the powerful role of shared narratives and to reimagine our interactions within both physical and digital worlds.</p>
          
          <p>My projects often explore game theory, human behavior, and incentives as tools for creating systems that drive collective progress. Outside of work, I enjoy life with my two kids and two dogs, embracing the interplay between family and creativity. I'm passionate about fostering creativity, challenging norms, and building a future where design, technology, and human connection thrive together.</p>
