    Infinite Grants is an exploration in grants funding within decentralized networks, moving away from rigid cycles and fixed amounts toward something more fluid, more aligned with the organic nature of innovation. Imagine a world where grants are not just a one-time deal but an ongoing conversation between the builders and the communityâ€”a conversation that evolves as projects progress, as needs change, and as goals sharpen. We're starting to see some experiments in this space including Rounds.wtf and Vrbs streaming grants. From Vrbs, "Get paid every second to bring your best ideas to life with Vrbs and make positive impact in the world."

    ## Continuous Funding: The Rhythm of Progress

    Traditionally, grants have been bound by deadlines and seasons, creating a start-stop rhythm that often disrupts the flow of innovation. Infinite Grants, on the other hand, keep the music playing. They allow projects to tap into resources whenever they need them, without waiting for the next round or fearing the silence when the round ends.

    ## Milestone-Based Disbursement

    But this isn't a free-for-all. Funding can be tied milestones, ensuring that every step forward is earned. Projects receive what they need when they prove they're ready for it, creating a feedback loop where success breeds success.

    ## Streaming Grants

    Streaming Grants introduce a continuous, per-second flow of funds to specific outcomes within a DAO. Unlike traditional grants, which are disbursed in lump sums or at milestones, Streaming Grants provide a constant pulse of resources, allowing for real-time adjustments based on evolving priorities. DAO members can reallocate their voting power at any time, ensuring that funds are always directed where they are most needed, fostering a more responsive and dynamic funding environment. This approach not only supports ongoing projects but also empowers builders with consistent, predictable backing.

    ## Scalable Support: Growing Projects

    As projects grow, so does their need for support. Infinite Grants will need to scale with them, offering more as they achieve more ensuring that projects with real impact have the resources they need to continue delivering value.

    ## Aligned Incentives

    Core to Infinite Grants are aligned incentives. They're structured to ensure that both the grantor and the grantee are on the same page, working toward the same long-term vision. It's a partnership, not a transaction, built on mutual benefit and sustained by shared goals.

    ## Infinite Grants in Blockchain Ecosystems

    **DAOs:** Infinite Grants could be a lifeline for DAOs, providing continuous support for projects that advance their mission. It's a way to keep the energy flowing, to keep the momentum going.

    **Public Goods:** In the realm of public goods, where maintenance and development never really end, Infinite Grants offer a sustainable funding model that recognizes the ongoing nature of the work.

    **Ecosystem Growth:** For blockchain networks, Infinite Grants could be the key to fostering long-term ecosystem growth, supporting projects that drive adoption, usability, and scalabilityâ€”projects that keep the network alive and thriving.

    ## Challenges

    The sustainability of the grant pool is the biggest risk. Without careful design and management, the risk of depletion is real. Governance plays a crucial role here, ensuring that funds are allocated wisely and in line with the ecosystem's long-term goals.

    ## Measuring Impact

    Finally, clear metrics are essential. We need to know that the funds are making a difference, that the projects are delivering on their promise. We want to focus on investing in progress, measuring impact, and ensuring that every grant is a step toward a larger vision.

    Infinite Grants are more than just a funding model; they're a new way of thinking about how we support innovation and growth. They're about keeping the conversation going, keeping the rhythm steady, and ensuring that the music of progress never stops.

      content: "I think this complements the other deficiency I think affects grants programs.\n\nit would be great to modulate funding based on socialfi engagement (filtered for whatever moves the DAO forward, probably weighted by account engagement), but additionally, I think it would be great to meritocratically modulate a collateralization ratio for the grant token (something hard like ETH) for borrowing operational funds (something convenient like USDC). that way, the treasury is rate-limited from exfiltration (maturation from ETH to CR), but the most intense projects would naturally have a pivot to being yet another aligned body (could even try alchemix-style mechanics to naturally distribute itself).\n\nobviously, this would be systemically risky, so there would have to be other permissions & considerations. but I think it would leverage skin in the game to much greater capital utilization, also providing DAO supporters to signal confidence or lack thereof by lending.",
