    CharmVerse has officially launched the Scout Game Waitlist—a two-week campaign designed to build momentum and gather crucial feedback ahead of our game's full release. Sign up today and secure your spot among the first to experience the Scout Game when it launches.

    The Waitlist itself is gamified. The more clicks your unique frame receives, the more points you accumulate. As you level up, you gain early access to the game and earn credits to scout top builders. High-level Scouts will also receive bonus credits, allowing you to collect valuable builder NFTs at no cost.

    The Waitlist game lasts 2 weeks and then leads into the Scout Game.

    TL;DR: Think fantasy sports for open-source development. Collect developer NFTs, earn points when they merge Pull Requests in approved repositories, and win rewards. Some projects even offer additional crypto incentives.

    The Scout Game is designed to reward individuals for identifying and supporting emerging developer talent within onchain ecosystems. As a Scout, your goal is to recognize promising builders early in their journey and help them gain visibility. In return, you earn rewards based on their success.

    This model shifts the focus away from pure memetics and toward supporting talent. When supporting developers who contribute to open-source projects, you align your incentives with both their growth and the broader goal of the blockchain ecosystem to attract and empower more builders.

    By aligning the interests of Scouts, Builders, and blockchain ecosystems seeking to attract more development on their chains and protocols, the Scout Game addresses key challenges in discovering, rewarding, and nurturing open-source contributors and project developers.

    ## Identifying Talent Early

    The Scout Game rewards those with a keen eye for builders, offering Scouts an opportunity to participate in the success of developers they believe in. It effectively crowdsources talent discovery, decentralizing the process of identifying high-potential contributors.

    ## Rewarding Meaningful Contributions

    For builders, the Scout Game offers an alternative way to gain recognition and resources by directly tying rewards to tangible contributions. Builders can focus on delivering value while gaining visibility and support through the network of Scouts.

    ## Ecosystem Growth

    Blockchain ecosystems have long relied on grants and hackathons to attract developers, but these approaches come with challenges. Grants are costly and often deliver inconsistent results, with developers frequently moving on after receiving funding. Hackathons can produce quick wins, but rarely lead to sustained contributions. The Scout Game introduces a more durable solution by incentivizing developers to engage deeply with a blockchain ecosystem. Through ongoing contributions to open-source projects, developers not only gain visibility but also become integral, long-term contributors to the ecosystem.

    The Scout Game taps into the core ethos of decentralized networks—community-driven discovery and value creation—by rewarding those who contribute to the growth and sustainability of crypto networks.

    ## How it Works for Scouts

    Scouts participate by collecting NFTs associated with top builders during each season. As these builders excel—by contributing to codebases—Scouts accumulate points. The more successful your chosen builders, the more points you earn.

    Scouts are not only identifying stars—they are earning real rewards as their builders thrive. By accumulating Scout Points, you can exchange them for credits to scout even more builders, boosting your standing within the game and increasing your potential rewards.

    Key Scout Actions:
    - Collect NFTs from top builders every season.
    - Earn Scout Points when the builders you back succeed in open-source contributions.

    ## How it Works for Builders

    Builders in the Scout Game gain recognition by actively contributing to approved projects. Each season lasts three months, and builders earn Scout Points by completing specific tasks tied to their contributions.

    Ways Builders Earn Points:
    - Impact! Submit a Pull Request (PR) to an approved open-source project and get it accepted.
    - First Commit! Make your first-ever code contribution to an approved project.
    - Streaks! Complete a streak of three PRs within a specific time period.

    The Scout Game introduces a new approach to discovering and rewarding emerging talent in onchain ecosystems. By engaging Scouts to identify promising builders and rewarding meaningful open-source contributions, it creates an environment where both parties benefit from each other's success. Unlike traditional methods like grants or hackathons, which often yield short-term or inconsistent results, the Scout Game fosters long-term engagement and growth within blockchain ecosystems.

    Whether you're a Scout helping developers gain visibility or a builder making impactful contributions, the game rewards those who contribute to the sustainability and growth of decentralized networks.

    With the Waitlist already live, now is the perfect time to join, secure your spot, and become part of a community shaping the future of open source blockchain development.
