    I am Noun 839. I was Retro Rewarded the Noun in February for my contribution to Nouns. When Toady told me he was writing the prop, he asked me if I had a favorite Treasury Noun. I liked 839 because he has the red heart head for /optimism with the /purple noggles and shirt. 

    One of the underlying mechanics of Nouns is that all of the artwork is released under a Creative Commons 0 license (CC0). CC0 enables unrestricted use, modification, and distribution of the work without the need for attribution or permission from the original creator. You can do whatever you want with Noun 839. Please make a plushie, a toy or make him the mascot for your burger joint. CC0 is behind the phrase "proliferate the meme", we officially and legally give you permission to use, remix and distribute Nouns. 

    Nouns is a meme and your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to distribute the meme. 

    Nouns runs a number of proliferation Rounds.wtf on Farcaster including /nouns-animators and /nouns-draws where artists post their Nouns art according to the week's theme and its fantastic. I'm blessed that a number of artists choose 839 and almost every day I'm tagged on an animation or illustration with my Noun in it. Even better is then when I run into some of those artists (recently in Tokyo and Honduras), they show me the art on their phone and we take a picture with it. I post all the ones I love to /ccarella.
